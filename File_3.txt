Richard Meiser-Stedman, a Professor of Clinical Psychology at Norwich Medical School, said: “PTSD can be a devastating reaction to trauma. Talking therapies (e.g. trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy) are effective treatments for adults with PTSD. However, such therapies typically involve detailed discussion of trauma, with some mental health professionals being concerned that this approach may not work when people have suffered multiple traumas, such as combat or sexual abuse. In our review of over 130 clinical trials we found that adults whose PTSD stemmed from multiple trauma experiences gained the same degree of benefit as adults with single-event-related PTSD. We hope this evidence will encourage therapists and adults suffering from PTSD, regardless of what type of experiences they have had, to consider trying this powerful treatment.”

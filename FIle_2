The study was led by psychologists Dr Thole Hoppen and Prof Nexhmedin Morina from the Department for Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy at the University of Münster, alongside Prof Richard Meiser-Stedman from the University of East Anglia, Dr Ahlke Kip from the University of Münster, and Prof Marianne Skogbrott Birkeland from the Research Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies in Norway.
Richard Meiser-Stedman, a Professor of Clinical Psychology at Norwich Medical School, said: “PTSD can be a devastating reaction to trauma. Talking therapies (e.g. trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy) are effective treatments for adults with PTSD. However, such therapies typically involve detailed discussion of trauma, with some mental health professionals being concerned that this approach may not work when people have suffered multiple traumas, such as combat or sexual abuse.

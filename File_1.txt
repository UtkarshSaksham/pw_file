The findings of the study were published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal recently.

“In addition to patients’ fear of talking about their traumatic experiences, some psychotherapists hesitate to directly address traumatic experiences during treatment. However, trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy – a form of psychotherapy which helps process the traumatic memories – is not only very effective according to the accumulated data but more effective than non-trauma-focused interventions,” Prof Hoppen said.

Consequently, trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy is the first line of treatment recommended in national and international treatment guidelines. Prof Hoppen added that future research requires longer-term data to enable a more solid estimation of the long-term efficacy of the treatment.
